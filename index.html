        <p>
            After earning a Marketing Degree from the College of Charleston I decided to move to London for a Sports Marketing Internship with a local children's soccer coaching company, We Make Footballers. While at We Make Footballers, I assisted with more than just marketing duties. Being part of a small team I took part in many facets of the company, including web and creative design. 
            After the struggle that came with dealing with and finding the right freelance developers, having to do a little coding, and after seeing that the developer we used was doing so from Jamaica... I notcied the need for efficient, clean, and effective developers.  Upon returning from my Internship in London I worked as a Mobile App Squad member for the NBA's Charlotte Hornets.
            I was able to combine my love of sports with my interest in tech, but seeing that I had needed to know more about the tech side. Therefore, I enrolled into The Coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte.
        </p>

        <p>Upon graduating from the Bootcamp I plan to use the skills I have learned in order to pursue either a career as a marketing professional in the tech industry, or a full-stack developer for a promising startup, all the while, freelancing my web development skills to earn supplemental income enabling to pursue my passions.
