    <!--Bio Paragraphs-->
    <p> I graduated from the College of Charleston with a Degree in Marketing, upon graduating I moved to London for a Sports Marketing Internship where I was introduced to developing websites through Wordpress. 
        When returning to the states I worked for the Charlotte Hornets marketing their new app
    </p>

    <p>While working closely with tech I decided to pursue learning coding languages to help further myself with the skills that will prepare for the future. I enrolled into the Coding Bootcamp at UNCC, so well see what happens.
